CommonTrend
===========

Please see the published version on the official R website: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CommonTrend/index.html

Description
--------------------
*CommonTrend*:    Extract and plot common trends from a cointegration system. Calculate P-value for Johansen Statistics

Directly extract and plot stochastic common trends from the cointegration system using different approaches, currently including Kasa (1992) and Gonzalo and Granger (1995). The approach proposed by Gonzalo and Granger, also known as Permanent-Transitory Decomposition, is widely used in macroeconomics and market microstructure literature. The Kasa's approach, on the other hand, has a nice property that it only uses the super consistent estimator: the cointegration vector 'beta'. In addition, this package can also calculate P-value for Johansen Statistics according to the approximation method proposed by Doornik (1998).
